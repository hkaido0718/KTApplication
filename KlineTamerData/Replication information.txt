Replication files for "Bayesian inference in a class of partially identified models" by Brendan Kline and Elie Tamer

Example 1 (interval identified): simulation_interval.m
Example 2 (interval-censored regression): simulation_censored.m 
	Note: get true identified set by setting n = 100000
Example 3 (binary game): simulation_game.m
Empirical example: empirical_game.m
